# DataStructure
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.
Each data structure contains information about the data values, relationships between the data and functions that can be applied to the data.

<h2>Types of data structures</h2>
Data structure types are determined by what types of operations are required or what kinds of algorithms are going to be applied. These types include:

<h4>Arrays</h4> An array stores a collection of items at adjoining memory locations. 
Items that are the same type get stored together so that the position of each element can be calculated or retrieved easily. 
Arrays can be fixed or flexible in length.</br>
<h4>Stack</h4> A stack stores a collection of items in the linear order that operations are applied. 
This order could be last in first out (LIFO) or first in first out (FIFO).</br>
<h4>Queues</h4> A queue stores a collection of items similar to a stack; however, the operation order can only be first in first out.</br>
<h4>Linked lists</h4> A linked list stores a collection of items in a linear order. 
Each element, or node, in a linked list contains a data item as well as a reference, or link, to the next item in the list.</br>
<h4>Trees</h4> A tree stores a collection of items in an abstract, hierarchical way. 
Each node is linked to other nodes and can have multiple sub-values, also known as children.</br>
<h4>Graphs</h4> A graph stores a collection of items in a non-linear fashion. 
Graphs are made up of a finite set of nodes, also known as vertices, and lines that connect them, also known as edges. 
These are useful for representing real-life systems such as computer networks.</br>
<h4>Tries</h4> A trie, or keyword tree, is a data structure that stores strings as data items that can be organized in a visual graph.</br>
<h4>Hash tables</h4> A hash table, or a hash map, stores a collection of items in an associative array that plots keys to values. 
A hash table uses a hash function to convert an index into an array of buckets that contain the desired data item.</br>
